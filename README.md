#HTML5 Canvas

##Image Filters on Canvas Element

The HTML5 canvas element can be used to write (instagram like) image filters. What you need to do is draw an image onto a canvas, read back the canvas pixels, and run your filter on them. You can then write the result onto a new canvas.

Here I have demonstraed few basic effects, 1) Blue Tint, 2) Grayscale, 3) Brighten, 4) Old Timey, 5) Exposure; to showcase how the image filters mechanism works with the HTML5 Canvas.

This can be expanded to include several other effects shown in the Instagram or Google Photos application.
